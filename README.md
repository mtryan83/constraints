# Constraints

Repository for code to generate/plot/analyze/etc cooling curve constraints for Dissipative Dark Matter (especially ADM). Originally based on/developed for [2009.05209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05209).

See the [testing notebook](https://github.com/mtryan83/constraints/blob/main/testing.ipynb) for examples of how to use the included packages and current results.
