! Dark Matter model with atomic dark matter particles
!
! based on : collapseZ test, modifications from private communication
!            with Guido D'Amico, and 2110.11971
!
!***************************************************************
!This is a simple one-zone collapse test following
! the chemical and thermal evolution of a primordial cloud.
!The dynamics is described by the Larson-Penston-type
! similar solution and includes cooling and heating processes.
!For additional details look also to the DarkKROME, Omukai 2000, 
! and KROME papers.
!***************************************************************
! 
! Makefile note: this test comes with its own makefile. The primary
!   difference between this makefile and the common one is defaulting
!   to gfortran. It also includes starting_densities and specfun as
!   objects and includes the hdf5 libraries for starting_densities.
!   You may need to modify accordingly.
